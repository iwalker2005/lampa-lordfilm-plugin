# Spec Entry Point

If you need full requirements, use this order:

1. Start with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system overview.
2. Open the full Russian spec file only for exact requirement wording:
   - `docs/ТЗ_LordFilm_Lampa_v1.1.md`
   - or root copy: `ТЗ_LordFilm_Lampa_v1.1.md`

Read targeted sections only to keep LLM context small.
